<p>Recorded on the anniversary of JFK's assassination and 21 years after their historic '92 New Year mix on Kiss 100 FM, Coldcut meets The Orb inna Uptown Youth House for the Return Trip. Matt Black and Jonathan More alongside studio accomplice Dor Wand got suitably enhanced with Dr LX Paterson and Youth for a multi-player late night jam session lasting over 3 hours. They then entrusted the multitracks of the set to DJ Food who heroically edited, condensed and massaged the sprawling swamp of sound into a tight - but also loose - 2 hour Solid Steel session.</p><p>Swimming through the mix are Lee Perry, Killing Joke, Sun Ra, William Burroughs, Teebs, Ry Cooder, Actress, Prince Jammy, Iggy Pop, Monty Python, Hank Williams and Hal 9000. Alongside unreleased dubs from the players themselves, remixes and versions of tunes old and new, the complete track listing for this marathon set may never be fullly disclosed. It's 2 hours, 10 minutes of sonic secrets to melt your mind, probably best listened to in headphones late at night with all suitable facilities for the full effect. Enjoy this trip.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Coldcut" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">twitter.com/Coldcut</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Orbinfo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">twitter.com/Orbinfo</a></p><p>Part 1 + 2 - Coldcut meets The Orb - The Return Trip</p><p>The Orb â€“ Hold Me (Interlude) (feat.
