<p>Solid Steel in association with Serato (4th January) It's 2013 and we're celebrating 25 years of 'The Broadest Beats' on Solid Steel. But first we take a look at where it all began, before Solid Steel even started. <br>On the pirate station Kiss FM in the mid to late eighties Matt Black and Jon More both had separate shows, we hear clips from both and then as they joined forces in 1988 prior to Kiss shutting down whilst applying for legal status at the end of the year.</p><p>To start with we scan the airwaves through various London Pirate Stations of the time, landing at Kiss 94 FM to hear Matt Black's Mastermix Dance Party dropping exclusive Coldcut tracks for the first time and music from the emerging House scene. Jon More takes over with the Meltdown Party playing 'new' releases from The Beastie Boys, Eric B &amp; Rakim and Adrian Sherwood plus the original version of 'The Only Way Is Up' that they later covered with Yazz and took to the top of the charts.</p><p>Then we hear them together for their last show on the Pirate Kiss 94 FM whilst waiting for a licence. Music comes from Kraftwerk plus a Todd Terry workout and, as they say goodbye, we hear a farewell from Kiss founder Gordon Mac and the announcement of a new commercial station for London...</p><p>You can see a documentary about Kiss FM from its pirate roots, through applying to become a legal station, to the launch here <a href="http://vimeo.com/45893966" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">vimeo.com/45893966</a></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/Coldcut" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">twitter.com/Coldcut</a></p><p>Matt Black - Mastermix Dance Party 1988</p><p>Mongo Santamaria   _   Cold Sweat  _   Columbia<br>Floormaster Squeeze _   Kick out the James (Spend version)  _   Ahead Of Our Time<br>Kool and the gang  _   Who's gonna take the weight _   De-Lite<br>James Brown  _   The Payback Mix (Coldcut Meets The Godfather)   _   Urban<br>Marshall Jefferson Presents Truth  _   Open Our Eyes   _   Big Beat<br>Rick "Hollywood" Pagan  _   Make them sweat _   Music Village<br>Bam Bam    _   Where's Your Child? _   Desire Records</p><p>Jon More - Meltdown Party 1986/87</p><p>Vicki Anderson _   Message From The Soul Sisters   _   King<br>Ray Baretto _   Soul drummer    _   Fania<br>Beastie Boys   _   Brass monkey    _   Def Jam<br>Age of chance    _   Kisspower   _   White<br>Tackhead   _   The Game (You'll Never Walk Alone) (Dub)    _   4th &amp; Broadway<br>Eric B &amp; Rakim    _   I ain't no joke _   4th &amp; Broadway<br>Percussion Allstars   _   Percussion  _   Modern Records<br>Prince buster _   Ride A Donkey   _   Fab<br>Lola _   Wax the van _   Jump Street <br>Manu Dibango    _   Abele Dance _   Celluloid<br>Housemaster Boys   _   House nation    _   Dance Mania<br>Papa Noel    _   Bel ami _   Industrie Africaine Du Disque<br>Otis Clay  _   The only way is up  _   Blues R&amp;B</p><p>Coldcut - Solid Steel 1988</p><p>Royal House    _   Can you party?  _   Idlers<br>Black Riot    _   A day in the life   _   Fourth Floor<br>Todd Terry  _   Just Wanna Dance    _   Sleeping Bag<br>Swan Lake   _   The dream   _   Bad Boy Records<br>Kevin Sanderson  _   The sound   _   KMS<br>Todd Terry   _   Weekend _   Sleeping Bag<br>Masters at work _   Dum Dum Cry _   Fourth Floor<br>Kraftwerk   _   Numbers _   EMI</p>
