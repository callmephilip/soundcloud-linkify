### Hello
Soundcloud Linkify is a Chrome Extension that identifies artists mentioned in tracklists for mixes and links to their Soundcloud pages so you don't have to copy and paste artists' names into the search bar. You can get it in [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/soundcloud-linkify/homkoibbemhcokjidkmmdepigpeefpbh). It looks something like this

### Support or Contact
Problems? Ping me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/callmephilip) or [submit a bug report](https://github.com/callmephilip/soundcloud-linkify/issues). This extension currently supports only certain formats of track lists. If a given format does not get interpreted correctly, let me know and chances are I'll implement it.
